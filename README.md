# DataStructures
A set of Data Structures that I always had a hard time understanding in University.

This repository contains a few basic datastructures that I always had challenges with in Unviersity, so I challenged myself to try and reimplement them. Hopefully my implementation is not to atrocious and can help future students.

I will continue to add some when possible since they are challenging to implement but also cool to use once completed.

# How to Build

Clone the project and run `mvn clean install`.
